There's no particularity in the build of the App, I made everything using apple's frameworks

I used Xcode 14.3

I'm going to list some improvements that I'm aware in this code

- I could have made some image caching to improve data usage
- I could have tested the App more extensively, but since it was a plus, I focused on the main feature, but the App is ready to be tested in all classes that is necessary to be tested
